### BTEC 330 Software Applications in the Life Sciences (01.6645) SP2022 {A great class to learn about the basic of coding and data analysis}
*write a small paragraph about what topic of this course you enjoyed the most* [^1]

[^1]: *The topic that I do enjoy the most in this class was command line and Rstadio. Since I fund command line easy to learn, also the code and exercise provide by the professor was very fun to do just by following the step that she gave to us on assignment 2. The Rstudio was hard at the beguining since I was just typing the code on the courses and follow the step without to know what I am to doing so far but I realy enjoy when I start to do assignment since I was trying to know what am I doing and why I am doing this. The process of makin table and plot on Rstudio is easy since we just type the code and the marchine understand what it has to do. This is my first classes where I am learning code language.*
